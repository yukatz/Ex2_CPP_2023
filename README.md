### Introduction
This is my second project in the CPP course - implementatio of cards War game.
This assignment is divided into 2:
- [1] Create classes for proper compilation of the demo.cpp and at least 20 test to functions given in demo.cpp.
- [2] The implementation of the functions.

### The 1'st part mission
Implement a general adaptive array in the C language. 
>Adaptive array - is an array that changes its size so that any reference to a negative index is valid. When you refer to an index where no value has been placed then NULL is returned. There is no preliminary information on the type of elements that will enter the array.
 
### Main Classes
- [x] **Demo**
  >
- [x] **Player** 
  >
- [x] **Game**
  >
- [x] **Card** 
  >
  
### Main Tests
For every function in demo (main) class, I build a test case.
  
- [x] **CHECK_NOTROWS** 
  >Checks if the function don't trow's an error(exsepropn).
- [x] **CHECK_TROWS** 
  >Checks if the function do trow an error(exsepropn) when something not valid hapened.
- [x] **Print Check** 
  >Checks the print outputs.
